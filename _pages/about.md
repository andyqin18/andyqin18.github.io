你好！Hola! こんにちは! 안녕하세요! (I don't speak all of them)

Hi! This is Andy from Shanghai. Welcome to my page where you can explore some of the [coooool things](http://andyqin18.github.io/projects/) I do. 

#### A Little Intro:
I got my Bachelor's degree in **Mechanical Engineering** at [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) in 2023, where I developed a huge interest in Robotics. I am currently a Master Student in **Robotics** at the [University of Michigan](https://robotics.umich.edu/) specialized in Machine Learning, Estimation and Control.

My interest lies in the applications of Deep Learning in **Computer Vision**, Navigation of **Mobile Robots**, and Optimal Control of **Articulated Limbs**.
